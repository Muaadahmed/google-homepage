This google homepage project is to help me grasp HTML and CSS.
Things learned throughout the project:

1. Image Sprite: 
   - You can create an image sprite in the CSS instead of creating an image element in the HTML and worry about making it fit like its supposed to in the CSS.

   - you have to give it a height and width for it to appear and the image will fit into that preset dimensions no matter how big it was when downloaded.
